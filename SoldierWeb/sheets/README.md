EARLY DRAFT#1
This is an ongoing story that is being written for Vice along with a companion piece for Slant. 

The military has been trying to revamp its battle armor, most recently by redesigning a pelvic protection system that has been less than ideal for dismounted troops who have to find and disarm explosives. This piece looks at the problems troops have had with their injuries whiel at home, especially dealing with having sex and maintaining relationships. 

Interactive feature #1- Interactive graphic. Designed through InDesign, coided through InDesign's SWF Interactive PDF feature. Generally, the workflow is design an image (or in this case the body and the helmet were downloaded from www.nounproject.com), give that object or text an interactive function then have it interact with buttons. 

Proposed future interactives - 
	Image: Full-geared female soldier, with layers of where ovaries are and where the armor covers the body and create "red" zones showing the areas where reporoductive organs are less protected. 

	Graphic #2- How the penis is reconstructed, shows a human body and highlights areas where skin is taken from to recreate a penis.
